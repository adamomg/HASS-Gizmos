# Using Hue Tap in Home Assistant

The basis of getting a Hue Tap to work is to create 2 sensors that monitor which button you pushed and when you pushed it. 

I got most of the directions from Robin Cole on this web page: https://www.hackster.io/robin-cole/hijack-a-hue-remote-to-control-anything-with-home-assistant-5239a4 - These directions refer to a Hue Remote, but I've had success with a Hue Tap.
